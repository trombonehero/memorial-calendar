8926 Mechanical Design Project II is the second of two capstone design courses in the Mechanical Discipline. Building on skills acquired in the first, student teams each choose a unique design challenge and then proceed to generate a solution. The problem statements are often drawn from industry and, where possible, interdisciplinary interaction is encouraged (for example, with business, computer science, or other engineering disciplines). In most cases, the problem proponent will act as the “client” and the team is expected to manage the client interaction process as well. Significant emphasis is placed on both oral and written communication of both the process and results. Wherever possible, each system or a critical component of it, will be prototyped and tested.
